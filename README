This project is composed in openGL using assimp, Anton's Math and other libraries

The scene should consist of a backdrop of the snow, with three snowmen (in a hierarchy) with a tree on each side.

The keyboard and mouse are both initialized.

The mouse rotates the snowman.
The keyboard arrows change the camera position and pressing 'M' starts music. Key 'N' pauses the music while key 'B' resumes the music after it's been paused.

Both font rendering, particle rendering and height map rendering were attempted for this project with no success.
